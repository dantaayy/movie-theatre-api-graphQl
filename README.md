## Introduction

In this project I will be utiliing GraphQL to grab data that is stored on my local machine. I will take this project and learn the basic concepts
of what it takes to build a working GraphQL server. By using Apollo Server to do this documentation and the schemas will be written out for me
as I write out the queries. Apollo Playgroun will do the heavy lifting of that process so I do not have to worry about it.
